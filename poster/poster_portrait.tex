Downloading novels online is a emerging requirement for modern Chinese netizens, such operation should be done as easy as possible on both computer and mobile devices. Current popular solutions including Google search a novel site, read it online, or Sina iAsk require follow many links to find the novel, and not friendly to mobile devices. NovelSearch is a elegant solution to this problem.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{Features}{name=contribution,column=0,below=problem}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Downloading a novel from NovelSearch only requires one input and one click:
%\begin{tabular}

%\end{tabular}
{\centering
\parbox[c]{0.49\linewidth}{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/search.png}\\\centering{(a) Input the name of the novel.}}
\parbox[c]{0.49\linewidth}{\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/results.png}\\\centering{(b) Click a result to start downloading.}}
}
\vspace{0.5em}

Novels are retrived from multiple source sites, results from all source sites that has this novel will appear on the result list. Click a result will start downloading either a txt or a rar file directly, without any redirect to the source site and time wasted on figuring out the location of download link.

NovelSearch's workflow is as follows
\begin{itemize}
\item User search on the web frontend
\item Web backend received search request
\item For every source site
\begin{itemize}
	\item Search the user request
	\item Find out download link
\end{itemize}
\item Gather results
\item Show results to user
\end{itemize}

For every source site, we wrote corresponding \emph{fetcher} to find download link by search keyword automatically. To add a source site, just add a fetcher for that site.

NovelSearch is wrote in Python, with Bootstrap for frontend, Flask as backend and BeautifulSoup as Html parser.

\headerbox{Conclusion}{name=conclusion,column=1,below=site}{
We demonstrated NovelSearch, which can download a novel with only one input and one click. NovelSearch is much simpler to use than alternative solutions, as well as friendly to mobile devices.
